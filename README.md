everything inside this repo, is from an old installation of my ubuntu/arch os while using a wm in this case i3/i3gaps! this is more of a backup in case i lose something but sure you can learn or skidd this :) 

some of the .sh and stuff may not work as it was made for my pop os/arch which but with minnor tweaking you can get it working on any distro, i may do it sometime later but am not using linux rn.

if you have any questions please send me a pm on discord!
